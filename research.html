<h2 id="1-dynamics-of-cultural-diversity">1. Dynamics of Cultural Diversity</h2>
<p>Understanding cultural change over time is the central focus for the field of cultural evolution. In 2014, I contributed a large-scale quantitative analysis of the East Asian board game of Go.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.04.001"><img src="../images/Fig3.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>recent evolution in Go opening strategy</em></p>
<p>Here we track specific opening variants as traits that change in frequency over time as players adopt innovations in play styles. Our major focus was on <em>strategic</em> social learning, in which individuals selectively draw upon information available from others. We developed a general method for measuring this, both by player and across the life course:</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.04.001"><img src="../images/Figure_5.PNG" alt=""></a><br>
<em>professional players follow different learning strategies, as do younger vs older players</em></p>
<p>Together with N.-Han Tran, I am working on a follow-up analysis comparing the development of skill in both Go and Chess.</p>
<p>I am also working with Timothy Waring and N.-Han Tran on the cognitive constraints in the <em>kolam</em> art form of South India. Here, we are focusing on the cognitive and social <em>constraints</em> on artistic patterns, accessible through the concept of a tradeoff.</p>
<p><img src="../images/evenness_richness_tradeoff.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Together with Joe Henrich and many others, I&rsquo;ve also contributed to the macro-historical debate on the emergence of moralizing gods worldwide.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/jwa2n"><img src="../images/m2_predictions_fig2_combined.png" alt=""></a><br>
<em>models of the timing of moralizng gods depend critically on our assumptions about unknown historical eras</em></p>

<h2 id="2-demographic-models-of-cultural-evolution">2. Demographic Models of Cultural Evolution</h2>
<p>The study of cultural evolution has been enhanced by mathematical models of demography. With Ryan Baldini, I wrote a derivation of Price&rsquo;s theorem that can be used to separate out cultural trends.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.21237/C7clio3212123"><img src="../images/snoob-evolution.png" alt=""></a><br>
<em>agent-based simulations show cultural change due to demographic forcing</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working with the Tsimane&rsquo; people of Bolivia on how these methods can be applied to studying the spread of bilingualism and language change, together with my students Anja Becker and Riana Minocher.</p>
<p>I also study the impact of cultural institutions on demography, such as an analysis with Siobhán Mattison of the Mosuo ethnic minority in Southwestern China.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160526"><img src="../images/honeycomb_patrilineal.png" alt=""></a><br>
<em>child number and sex determines subsequent reproduction in two lineage systems</em></p>

<h2 id="3-market-impacts-on-knowledge-wealth-and-health">3. Market Impacts on Knowledge, Wealth and Health</h2>
<p>Accultural and market-integration are dominant themes of fieldwork for many anthropologists. Several papers on the impacts of wealth on reproductive success and on children&rsquo;s wealth across the world.</p>
<p><img src="sfi-map" alt=""></p>
<p>Since 2012 I have worked with the Tsimane&rsquo; people. Recently I participated in a large-scale study of Tsimane&rsquo; cardiovascular health, led by Hillard Kaplan and Michael Gurven, finding that this Amerindian group has the lowest rates of aetherosclerosis and heart disease on record, concomitant with a physically demanding, calorie restricted lifestyle in a high-pathogen environment.</p>
<p>Since 2013 I have been studying diffusion of gasoline motors, which has transformed life for communities along the Maniqui river.</p>
<p>This fieldsite has also contributed to the ENDOW social network project, led by Jeremy Koster and Elenor Power.</p>

<h2 id="4-open-science--data-provenance">4. Open Science &amp; Data Provenance</h2>
<p>The use of large-scale databases offers exciting opportunities, but heightens the question of provenance. The Data Provenance Research Group at MPI-EVA focuses on how to improve this transparently, as part of the larger goals of open science.</p>
<p>Led by <a href="../people/">Riana Minocher</a>, we have recently completed a massive survey of the social learning literature in evolutionary sciences, finding that only 3 in 10 papers have recoverable data by request, and 1 in 5 results do not reproduce given data available.</p>

<p>Recently I have begun organizing the collection of hydrogen-breath test data at multiple department fieldsites to better understand the pattern of adult lactase persistence.</p>
