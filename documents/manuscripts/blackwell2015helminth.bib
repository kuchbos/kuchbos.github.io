	abstract = {Parasitic worms infect 2 billion people globally. Mostly, such infections are symptomless and individual worm burdens are low. Blackwell et al. monitored the fecundity of Tsimane women in Bolivia. These women have on average of 10 children in their lifetimes. However, if they had successive hookworm infections, lifetime births dropped to 7. Surprisingly, if the women were chronically infested with roundworm, they had as many as 12 children. These effects may relate to the balance of immune responses that the different worms induce, rather than to the physiological costs of parasitism.Science, this issue p. 970Infection with intestinal helminths results in immunological changes that influence co-infections, and might influence fecundity by inducing immunological states affecting conception and pregnancy. We investigated associations between intestinal helminths and fertility in women, using 9 years of longitudinal data from 986 Bolivian forager-horticulturalists, experiencing natural fertility and 70\% helminth prevalence. We found that different species of helminth are associated with contrasting effects on fecundity. Infection with roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) is associated with earlier first births and shortened interbirth intervals, whereas infection with hookworm is associated with delayed first pregnancy and extended interbirth intervals. Thus, helminths may have important effects on human fertility that reflect physiological and immunological consequences of infection.},
